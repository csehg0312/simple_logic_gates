## Introduction

Neural networks are powerful tools capable of learning complex patterns and relationships within data. In this project, we utilize JavaScript technologies to implement a simple neural network and demonstrate its functionality by training it to mimic the behavior of basic logic gates such as AND, OR, NAND, and XOR. Vue.js with Vite is employed for the frontend interface, providing an interactive platform to visualize the training process and results.

## Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you will need:

- Node.js
- Vue.js
- Vite
- Synaptic.js

You can install these dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install vue @vitejs/vite synaptic
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-neural-network-logic-gates.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd simple-neural-network-logic-gates
```

3. Install the necessary npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the development server:
